## Python understanding you should have first

There are a few structures in python you need to know to understand this tutorial

#### Lists/arrays.  

You will see these terms sometimes used interchangeably.  A list is in python is like it sounds, a list! it can be a list of anything: numbers, text, other lists, etc.  Python is very flexible like this, other languages often make you put only 1 type into a list.  Here is an example list
```
x = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

Often times in programming, we need to build lists of things, we dont always start off with values in the list.  To add values to the list, we should use the 'append' method
```
x = []
x.append('matt')
x.append('danny')
```
^^ the list now contains the strings matt and danny
